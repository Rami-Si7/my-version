Road to Glory (Greedy Mesh Generation) VLOG:

Date - 20/11/2024:
- after our first meeting when you asked from me to read Building a High-Performance Voxel Engine in Unity artical and try to implement it.
- at first not all was making sense to me so at fiirst i tried copy paste and see what happen, most of the time i got to many errors because someting does not match in Godot aas in Unity. so i had to look to watch many tutorials to make the basics work.
- at first day i did not really progresses although is spent so much time learning things probably most of the day. (5 hours) i think that i have spent more but it is okey.

- this day I have started progressing. Of course like every coder when things stops to make sense we delete and start over, so i did that.
- i understood the mesh algorithm way more and started with the basics, with greedy mesh our goal is to render the visable faces for air and what the player sees. So i understand that each faec is a square that construct from 2 triangles and each triagle is consist of 3 vertices. of course i know that but this is the key for greedy meshing
- so i succesed in build a voxel with all of it's faces. and tried to continue with applying it for chunks which is the key here. but did not progress cause i encountered an error multiple times (regarding PackedVecor3Array) which i sent you an email about. so decied it is enough for today.
- i worked on it for more than 7 hours, this include watching lectures, tutorials and having fun in the editor.

Date - 22/11/2024:
- I spent all day on the project. i solved the recent error and contunied progressing, my goal was to apply greedy meshing for all chunks in the world, i succeeded only for not rendering invisible faces in the chunk it self but not the boundry faces (the ones between each chunk)
- i tried many thing but i did not progress mush here is how it looked [Watch the video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1U0LGco8grP730v5HRNAZUZpkt0MRTjNm/view?usp=sharing)
